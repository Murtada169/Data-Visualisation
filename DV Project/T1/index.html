                    <p>The graph clearly indicates that Female gender are more prompted to Panic Attacks, whereas Males come in second.<br>
                        Also, it is noticable that as the interval of the grade increases the height of the sub-class increases, which means that the Higher the grade of the student, the higher the possibilities of having Panic Attacks.
                        Therefore, Bright students are advised to take care of themselves before it causes a panic attack.</p>

                    <p>The stacked bar chart above shows the relation between mothers level of education towards the child's academic performance. For reference the scores have been given ranges/subgroups from 0-60 and that is plotted using different colors in the stacked bars. The x axis is the level of mothers education from 1-4 ( primary to higher education) Y axis refers to the sum of scores. As we can see this graph clearly indicates that with rising level of mothers education the children performce generally increases whose mothers are well educated.</p>
                    <p>A point to realise is that, as the education level increases the higher GPA interval sizes increase and vice versa</p>

Y axis on the first graph refers to the max score for each group of absences and the Y axis on the second graph refers to the avg score of each group of absences. <br>Both of the graphs indicate that a higher absences rate leads to less scores in academics. The group with the max score is the absence group of 0-10 absences and the scores go down as the absences are increased which can be seen by looking at the graph's trend and the max score of the absence group of 50-60 which is almost 35 and the highest scores of less absences can go upto even above 55.</p>

                    <p>In todays world we have heard that a happy family plays a vital role in the success of a child.<br> Using this grouped bar chart we can see that. A set of data was collected from a school in Portugal which shows the impact of divorced parents on the Childs academic performance. The parents apart have been mentioned as (A) on the X axis and together has been mentioned with a (T). On the Y axis are the number students which fall into different groups of scores i.e the subgroups are ranged from 0-60.<br> The subgroups are referred to as the color of each bar. We can clearly see that the parents who are together their children perform better in academics and more number students in the (T) part lie inside the high ranges scores.</p>

                    <p>This graph represents the relation of the students residence towards the academic scores. Due to good facilities in the urban areas eg fast internet connection and moderns tech and several other factors we can see that the students who live in urban areas perform better than the students who live in rural areas. This horizontal bar graph shows the % of score from the total score for the two groups of students which were divided into urban and rural.<br> Approx 79% of the score in the final score belongs to the group of students who live in urban area. Hence we can clearly see the difference in the bargraph.</p>
